Alright guys.  Here's the deal.  If you haven't used Git or GitHub before, this will aid in your learning process.

First things first, read the [help pages](https://help.github.com/) (whichever relevent).

The basic workflow will (probably) be as follows:
* For the repo
* Make any neccessary changes, add files
* Make a pull request
* I will review the pull request, and merge the forks if approved

Good luck, have fun!
